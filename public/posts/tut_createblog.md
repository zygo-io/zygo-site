In this tutorial we are going to create a simple blog using the [example blogging framework](https://github.com/zygo-io/zygo-blog) written with zygo. Right from the start we are going to need a couple of tools, namely [JSPM](https://github.com/jspm/jspm-cli), our front-end package manager, and [Zygo](https://github.com/zygo-io/zygo-cli), our rendering server. So let's go ahead and install them with
`npm install -g jspm zygo`.

```javascript

```
