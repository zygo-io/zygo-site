## What does "zygomorphic" mean?
Originally mentioned as a [joke](https://wiki.haskell.org/Zygohistomorphic_prepromorphisms), much to our amusement we discovered it [actually](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floral_symmetry) has some relevance. Zygomorphic flowers can be divided with a single cut into two mirror-image halves. Similarly, zygo provides identical client/server rendering for your app. Go figure.
